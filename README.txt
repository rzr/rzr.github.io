Mapo is a geolocation application for the Tizen OS, developed with HTML5/CSS3 an jQuery.

http://notabug.org/tizen/mapo

This application is under GPL-3.0p license.


::: HISTORY :::

Development started on May 25 2013, just before showing Tizen at solutions linux in Paris France.

Used target was RD210 and it was continuously upgraded until then it was tested on RDPQ
but those 2 devices do not not support GPS.

Then on 2015 back from FOSDEM with a Z1 tizen phome,
I noticed that application is not available into TizenStore
which seems to be supported in France.

So it was uploaded again to Tizen store.
